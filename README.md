# Summer_of_Bitcoin_code_challenge

Bitcoin miners construct blocks by selecting a set of **transactions** from their mempool. Each transaction in the mempool:
includes a **fee** which is collected by the miner if that transaction is included in a block
has a **weight** , which indicates the size of the transaction
may have one or more **parent** transactions which are also in the mempool.

The miner selects an **ordered list** of transactions which have a combined weight below the maximum block weight. Transactions with parent transactions in the
mempool may be included in the list, but only if all of their parents appear before them in the list.

Naturally, the miner would like to include the transactions that maximize the total fee.

The task is to write a program which reads a file mempool.csv, with the format:

 **\<txid\>,\<fee\>,\<weight\>,\<parent_txids\>**

*txid* is the transaction identifier

*fee* is the transaction fee

*weight* is the transaction size

*parent_txids* is a list of the txids of the transaction’s unconfirmed parent transactions (confirmed parent transactions are not included in this list). It is of
the form: *\<txid1\>;\<txid2\>;...*

This repo contains code of my program which outputs txids, separated by newlines, which make a valid block(satisfying all constraints), maximizing the fee to the miner.
